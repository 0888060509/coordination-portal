# Login System Fixes - Logwork

## Previous Approach
1. Fixed authentication flow in useAuthMethods.ts
2. Improved redirection in LoginPage.tsx
3. Enhanced useAuthState.ts auth event handling
4. Fixed potential race conditions

## New Approach (Second Attempt)
1. Completely refactored the login function in useAuthMethods.ts to be more direct and reliable
   - Added explicit error handling and better state management
   - Ensured navigation happens immediately after user data is set
   - Improved error feedback for users

2. Simplified useAuthState.ts for better flow control
   - Streamlined the auth state change listener to handle events more consistently
   - Added direct navigation triggers for SIGNED_IN events
   - Improved session handling and user state management

3. Enhanced LoginPage.tsx with better timeout handling
   - Added session verification after timeouts
   - Implemented more robust OAuth hash processing
   - Added user feedback for login attempts that take too long
   - Provided reset functionality for stalled login attempts

4. Fixed synchronization issues between auth state changes and UI updates
   - Ensured consistent state between authentication and navigation
   - Removed race conditions in auth event processing
   - Improved error feedback throughout the authentication flow
