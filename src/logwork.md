## 2025-03-17: Fixed Authentication Infinite Reload Loop

### Issues Identified:
1. Authentication circular redirects causing continuous page reloads
2. Multiple components trying to handle authentication redirects simultaneously
3. No cooldown mechanism to prevent rapid consecutive redirects
4. Improper ordering of React context providers in App.tsx
5. Error boundary not properly handling authentication issues

### Changes Made:
1. Enhanced ErrorBoundary component to:
   - Better capture and display errors
   - Clear authentication state when errors occur
   - Provide more user-friendly error recovery options

2. Fixed navigationService.ts to:
   - Implement proper cooldown between navigation attempts
   - Add more comprehensive redirect loop prevention
   - Improve debug logging for navigation issues
   - More robust path checking before redirects

3. Improved ProtectedRoute component to:
   - Add better debug logging
   - Reduce wait time for force-rendering content (from 5s to 3s)
   - Handle edge cases more gracefully
   - Improve timeout behavior

4. Enhanced useRedirectAuth hook to:
   - Track redirect attempts to prevent loops
   - Share cooldown timing with navigationService
   - Add component-level redirect tracking
   - Skip redundant session checks

5. Updated App.tsx to:
   - Correct the provider nesting order
   - Improve error boundary implementation
   - Simplify overall structure

### Testing:
- Successfully tested navigation between pages
- Verified authentication states properly maintain between refreshes
- Confirmed error boundary captures authentication-related errors

### Next Steps:
1. Continue monitoring for any remaining navigation issues
2. Consider refactoring large components:
   - useAuthState.ts (211 lines)
   - useAuthMethods.ts (365 lines)
   - navigationService.ts
3. Improve the error reporting system to capture more details

## 2025-03-17: Fixed Bookings and Profiles Relationship

### Issues Identified:
1. Database query error: "Could not find a relationship between 'bookings' and 'profiles' in the schema cache"
2. Incorrect foreign key reference in getUserBookings and getBookingById methods

### Changes Made:
1. Updated bookingService.ts to:
   - Remove the explicit foreign key hint ('bookings_user_id_fkey') in profile queries
   - Simplified the join between bookings and profiles tables
   - Keep the same data transformation logic to maintain compatibility with existing components

### Testing:
- Verified bookings now load correctly on the bookings page
- Confirmed booking details can be viewed without errors

### Next Steps:
1. Consider adding explicit foreign key relationships in the database schema for better clarity
2. Review other services for similar issues with table relationships
3. Add error handling to show user-friendly messages when database queries fail
