## 2025-03-17: Fixed Navigation Function Import Error

- Fixed TypeScript error in `useAuthMethods.ts` by updating import from `forceToDashboard` to `navigateToDashboard`
- Updated `useRedirectAuth.ts` to maintain API consistency while using the centralized navigation functions
- Ensured consistent navigation function names across the application

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the function names exported in `navigationService.ts` and the names being imported in `useAuthMethods.ts`. The fix ensures that all components use the centralized navigation service with consistent function names.

## 2025-03-17: Fixed Duplicate Sidebar Bug

- Fixed UI bug causing duplicate sidebars to appear on several pages
- Removed duplicate sidebar implementation from BookingsPage
- Updated AppLayout to be the single source of sidebar rendering
- Enhanced UIContext with persistence and mobile responsiveness
- Simplified page components to focus on content rather than layout

The issue was caused by multiple sidebar implementations being rendered simultaneously. BookingsPage and potentially other pages were rendering their own sidebars while the AppLayout was also rendering a sidebar. The fix centralizes sidebar management to ensure only one sidebar is rendered at a time.
