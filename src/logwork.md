### Fixed Navigation Issues in Protected Routes

**Problem:**
- Users were unable to navigate to pages like /rooms, /rooms/:id, /bookings, /bookings/:id, /settings, and /profile
- The application was getting stuck during navigation
- React Router was not properly updating the UI when routes changed

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Updated `navigationService.ts` to use React Router's history API instead of direct `window.location` changes
   - Added a new `navigateTo` function for SPA navigation
   - Modified `forceToDashboard` and `forceToLogin` to dispatch PopStateEvent after history pushState

2. Improved the `DashboardLayout.tsx` component
   - Fixed how navigation is handled throughout the component
   - Used useNavigate hook consistently for navigation

3. Updated `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component
   - Added proper cleanup with isMountedRef to prevent memory leaks
   - Improved loading state handling
   - Fixed session verification and route protection logic

4. Enhanced `useRedirectAuth.ts` hook
   - Used React Router's navigate function instead of direct location changes
   - Improved session checking logic
   - Added proper cleanup for intervals and subscriptions

5. Updated query client configuration in App.tsx
   - Added staleTime to reduce redundant API calls
   - Improved route organization

**Key Takeaways:**
- React Router navigation should be used consistently throughout the app
- Direct `window.location` changes should be avoided in a SPA when possible
- Memory leaks from unmounted components must be prevented with proper cleanup
- Multiple navigation methods should be harmonized to work together

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor the application for any remaining navigation issues
- Consider refactoring large components like ProtectedRoute.tsx into smaller, more focused components
- Implement better error handling for navigation failures

### Fixed White Screen Issues with Error Boundaries and Component Hierarchy

**Problem:**
- White screens appeared on all pages
- React errors in console about "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"
- Context errors: "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider"
- Select component errors: "A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string"

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Added a global `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and display React errors gracefully
   - Implemented fallback UI with reload options
   - Added detailed error messaging for debugging

2. Fixed context and routing order in `App.tsx`
   - Ensured proper nesting of providers (AuthProvider, Router)
   - Simplified the routing structure to prevent context access issues

3. Fixed React hook rule violations in `useAuthState.ts`
   - Used useRef correctly to track component mounted state
   - Prevented conditional hook calls causing "hooks rendered" errors
   - Added proper cleanup for all hooks

4. Improved navigation service reliability
   - Simplified to use direct `window.location.href` for critical navigations
   - Removed complex React Router manipulation that was causing issues
   - Added better logging for navigation debugging

5. Fixed loading state issues in `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
   - Added safety timeouts to force exit loading states after a reasonable time
   - Improved error handling and user feedback during loading failures

**Key Takeaways:**
- Error boundaries are essential for preventing white screens in React apps
- Hook rules must be strictly followed (no conditional hooks)
- Context providers must properly wrap components that use them
- Direct navigation is sometimes more reliable than router manipulation
- Timeout safeties are important to prevent infinite loading states

**Next Steps:**
- Create more focused, smaller components from large ones like ProtectedRoute
- Add more comprehensive error logging
- Implement better form validation to prevent Select component errors

### Fixed Select Component and Context Errors

**Problem:**
- Select components throwing errors about empty string values
- "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" errors
- White screens persisting in some areas

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Fixed Select components in RoomList.tsx
   - Updated empty string values to use "_all" as a non-empty string value
   - Added unique key props to prevent React key warnings
   - Ensured all SelectItem components have proper values

2. Enhanced React error boundary with more detailed error reporting
   - Added component stack trace display
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Added collapsible details for technical information

3. Fixed App.tsx component provider ordering
   - Ensured BrowserRouter wraps QueryClientProvider and AuthProvider
   - Fixed component nesting to prevent context access issues

**Key Takeaways:**
- Select components must have non-empty string values
- Provider ordering in React is critical for context to work properly
- Detailed error boundaries improve debugging experience
- Unique keys are essential for React component lists

**Next Steps:**
- Continue refactoring large components into smaller, focused ones
- Implement comprehensive error reporting
- Add unit tests for critical navigation and authentication flows
