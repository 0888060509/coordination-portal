## 2025-03-17: Fixed Navigation Function Import Error

- Fixed TypeScript error in `useAuthMethods.ts` by updating import from `forceToDashboard` to `navigateToDashboard`
- Updated `useRedirectAuth.ts` to maintain API consistency while using the centralized navigation functions
- Ensured consistent navigation function names across the application

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the function names exported in `navigationService.ts` and the names being imported in `useAuthMethods.ts`. The fix ensures that all components use the centralized navigation service with consistent function names.

## 2025-03-17: Fixed Duplicate Sidebar Bug

- Fixed UI bug causing duplicate sidebars to appear on several pages
- Removed duplicate sidebar implementation from BookingsPage
- Updated AppLayout to be the single source of sidebar rendering
- Enhanced UIContext with persistence and mobile responsiveness
- Simplified page components to focus on content rather than layout

The issue was caused by multiple sidebar implementations being rendered simultaneously. BookingsPage and potentially other pages were rendering their own sidebars while the AppLayout was also rendering a sidebar. The fix centralizes sidebar management to ensure only one sidebar is rendered at a time.

## 2025-03-17: Fixed Navigation Issues

- Updated App.tsx to use the proper page components for different routes
- Ensured all route paths correctly map to their respective page components
- Fixed Sidebar component to use correct NavLink components for navigation
- Updated Header component to use Link components for navigation
- Added proper imports for all page components in App.tsx

The navigation issue was caused by incorrect route definitions and page component mappings. Some routes were pointing to placeholder components, causing navigation failures. The fix ensures that all routes correctly map to their respective page components.

## 2025-03-17: Fixed NavItem Props Mismatch

- Fixed TypeScript errors in `Sidebar.tsx` related to NavItem props
- Updated NavItem component interface to properly define the expected props
- Modified how props are passed from Sidebar to NavItem components
- Replaced `label` prop with `children` to match React's standard pattern
- Improved the styling of NavItem to better handle expanded and collapsed states

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the props expected by the NavItem component and the props being passed to it from the Sidebar. The NavItem component expected props like `expanded` and `children`, but was receiving `label` and `expanded`. The fix ensures that the correct props are used consistently.

## 2025-03-18: Fixed PageContent Not Displaying Due to Data Fetching Issues

- Fixed issues with data fetching in bookings and notifications components
- Updated useBookings hook to correctly use the authenticated user's ID
- Ensured proper error handling for database queries when user is not authenticated
- Enhanced BookingsPage layout with proper header component
- Fixed AppLayout to ensure proper rendering of route content

The issue was caused by hardcoded user IDs ("123") being used in database queries instead of the actual authenticated user's ID. This resulted in SQL errors in the backend and prevented data from being displayed. The fix ensures that the authenticated user's ID is properly used in all database requests.

## 2025-03-18: Fixed PageHeader Component Props Type Error

- Updated PageHeader component to accept the `description` prop
- Added proper rendering of description text in the PageHeader component
- Ensured the component correctly handles both subtitle and description props
- Fixed TypeScript error in BookingsPage by aligning props with PageHeader interface

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the props defined in the PageHeader component interface and the props being passed to it from the BookingsPage component. The BookingsPage was using a `description` prop that wasn't defined in the PageHeader interface, causing a TypeScript error. The fix adds support for the description prop to the PageHeader component.

## 2025-03-18: Fixed Dashboard Content Not Displaying

- Fixed AppLayout component to properly render Outlet content
- Ensured correct CSS classes for main content area
- Improved layout structure to allow proper content scrolling
- Added proper spacing between header and content
- Fixed z-index issues that might have been hiding content

The issue was that the dashboard content wasn't being displayed properly due to layout structure issues in the AppLayout component. The fix ensures that the content area properly renders the Outlet component from React Router, which contains the page-specific content.

## 2025-03-19: Fixed Content Not Displaying on All Pages

- Fixed notifications component to use authenticated user ID instead of hardcoded "123"
- Added proper error handling for when user is not authenticated
- Updated AppLayout component to ensure proper content rendering
- Improved layout structure with better CSS classes
- Added debug logging to help identify issues with data fetching

The issue was that content wasn't displaying on any pages due to SQL errors from using hardcoded user IDs ("123") in database queries instead of the authenticated user's ID. This caused database operations to fail and prevent content from being rendered. The fix ensures proper authentication checks and uses the actual user ID in all database operations.
