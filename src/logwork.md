### Fixed Navigation Issues in Protected Routes

**Problem:**
- Users were unable to navigate to pages like /rooms, /rooms/:id, /bookings, /bookings/:id, /settings, and /profile
- The application was getting stuck during navigation
- React Router was not properly updating the UI when routes changed

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Updated `navigationService.ts` to use React Router's history API instead of direct `window.location` changes
   - Added a new `navigateTo` function for SPA navigation
   - Modified `forceToDashboard` and `forceToLogin` to dispatch PopStateEvent after history pushState

2. Improved the `DashboardLayout.tsx` component
   - Fixed how navigation is handled throughout the component
   - Used useNavigate hook consistently for navigation

3. Updated `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component
   - Added proper cleanup with isMountedRef to prevent memory leaks
   - Improved loading state handling
   - Fixed session verification and route protection logic

4. Enhanced `useRedirectAuth.ts` hook
   - Used React Router's navigate function instead of direct location changes
   - Improved session checking logic
   - Added proper cleanup for intervals and subscriptions

5. Updated query client configuration in App.tsx
   - Added staleTime to reduce redundant API calls
   - Improved route organization

**Key Takeaways:**
- React Router navigation should be used consistently throughout the app
- Direct `window.location` changes should be avoided in a SPA when possible
- Memory leaks from unmounted components must be prevented with proper cleanup
- Multiple navigation methods should be harmonized to work together

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor the application for any remaining navigation issues
- Consider refactoring large components like ProtectedRoute.tsx into smaller, more focused components
- Implement better error handling for navigation failures
