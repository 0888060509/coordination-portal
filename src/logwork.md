## 2025-03-17: Fixed Navigation Function Import Error

- Fixed TypeScript error in `useAuthMethods.ts` by updating import from `forceToDashboard` to `navigateToDashboard`
- Updated `useRedirectAuth.ts` to maintain API consistency while using the centralized navigation functions
- Ensured consistent navigation function names across the application

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the function names exported in `navigationService.ts` and the names being imported in `useAuthMethods.ts`. The fix ensures that all components use the centralized navigation service with consistent function names.

## 2025-03-17: Fixed Duplicate Sidebar Bug

- Fixed UI bug causing duplicate sidebars to appear on several pages
- Removed duplicate sidebar implementation from BookingsPage
- Updated AppLayout to be the single source of sidebar rendering
- Enhanced UIContext with persistence and mobile responsiveness
- Simplified page components to focus on content rather than layout

The issue was caused by multiple sidebar implementations being rendered simultaneously. BookingsPage and potentially other pages were rendering their own sidebars while the AppLayout was also rendering a sidebar. The fix centralizes sidebar management to ensure only one sidebar is rendered at a time.

## 2025-03-17: Fixed Navigation Issues

- Updated App.tsx to use the proper page components for different routes
- Ensured all route paths correctly map to their respective page components
- Fixed Sidebar component to use correct NavLink components for navigation
- Updated Header component to use Link components for navigation
- Added proper imports for all page components in App.tsx

The navigation issue was caused by incorrect route definitions and page component mappings. Some routes were pointing to placeholder components, causing navigation failures. The fix ensures that all routes correctly map to their respective page components.

## 2025-03-17: Fixed NavItem Props Mismatch

- Fixed TypeScript errors in `Sidebar.tsx` related to NavItem props
- Updated NavItem component interface to properly define the expected props
- Modified how props are passed from Sidebar to NavItem components
- Replaced `label` prop with `children` to match React's standard pattern
- Improved the styling of NavItem to better handle expanded and collapsed states

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the props expected by the NavItem component and the props being passed to it from the Sidebar. The NavItem component expected props like `expanded` and `children`, but was receiving `label` and `expanded`. The fix ensures that the correct props are used consistently.
