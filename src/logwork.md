# Login System Fixes - Logwork

## 1. Fixed authentication flow in useAuthMethods.ts
Modified the login function to explicitly navigate to the dashboard after successful user data retrieval. This ensures the user is redirected immediately after login, avoiding timing issues with state updates.

## 2. Improved redirection in LoginPage.tsx
Simplified the login submission flow to rely on the login function for navigation rather than duplicate navigation logic in the component. Also fixed checks for authenticated state to avoid race conditions.

## 3. Enhanced useAuthState.ts auth event handling
Added explicit navigation to dashboard when SIGNED_IN event occurs to ensure consistent redirection regardless of how authentication succeeds. This handles both regular login and OAuth authentication paths.

## 4. Fixed potential race conditions
Addressed timing issues in the auth flow by ensuring state is properly set before navigation attempts. Improved synchronization between authentication success and UI updates.

Each change helps ensure a more reliable authentication flow, particularly focusing on proper navigation after successful authentication.
